/**
 * PAYLOAD — JetSpa (aircraft detailing, KTEB / KMMU / KABE / KHPN).
 *
 * ⚠️  THIS CONFIG CONTAINS PLACEHOLDERS. IT MUST NOT SHIP.
 *
 * Facts that have not been supplied yet are filled with values containing the string
 * "PLACEHOLDER", by decision, so the site can be built and reviewed before onboarding
 * is complete. They are deliberately not plausible: a made-up street address that
 * looks real survives review and reaches production, while "PLACEHOLDER" in the footer
 * cannot. src/lib/site-config.ts warns on every build that they are still here, and
 * DS_STRICT=1 turns that warning into a build failure — set it in any deploy pipeline.
 *
 * The honest record of what is missing is clients/jetspa/source/intake.json, where
 * those fields are null. Fill intake first, then mirror the value here.
 *
 * Payloads import nothing; validation happens at the engine boundary in
 * src/lib/site-config.ts.
