/**
 * THE INTAKE CONTRACT — everything a new client site needs, in one file.
 *
 * One `intake.json` per client, at clients/<slug>/source/intake.json. It is the single
 * source of truth for three things that were previously three separate inputs:
 *
 *   1. site.config.ts          — the facts the engine validates at build time
 *   2. the merge-field token map — what {{custom_values.*}} resolves to on import
 *   3. the page inventory       — which services and areas exist, in what order
 *
 * WHY NULLS ARE ALLOWED
 * Onboarding never arrives complete. A field whose value is not yet known is `null`,
 * never a guess and never a plausible-looking placeholder — an invented phone number
 * that passes validation is far worse than a missing one that fails it. `null` is
 * carried into the payload as a TODO(fact-needed) marker, so the engine's own zod
 * validation refuses to build until a human supplies it. Nothing ships half-known.
 *
 * Run `node scripts/check-intake.mjs <slug>` to validate one and list what is missing.
